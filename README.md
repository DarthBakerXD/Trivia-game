# Trivia-game

Welcome to our Trivia Project Repository!

Our Python Test Client uses the "umsgpack" module, which is included in the branch

Our C++ Server uses the external json library made by nlohmann, which is included in the branch

Our C# Client uses libraries for Messagepack Serialization and De-Serialization that were acquired directly from the Visual Studio Package
Manager, They are not included in the project as Visual Studio redownloads missing packages on its own, as long as you have an internet connection, so please compile this project while connected to the internet, thank you :)
